# Model Checkpoints

This directory contains trained model checkpoints for the VeroAllarme relevance mask module.

## Files

After training, you'll find:

- `contrastive_epoch_*.pth` - Checkpoints from Phase 1 (contrastive learning)
- `contrastive_final.pth` - Final Phase 1 model
- `segmentation_epoch_*.pth` - Checkpoints from Phase 2 (segmentation)
- `segmentation_final.pth` - Final Phase 2 model
- `best_model.pth` - Best performing model (use this for inference)
- `config_*.yaml` - Training configurations

## Usage

Load a checkpoint for inference:

```python
from core.relevance_mask import RelevanceMaskPredictor

predictor = RelevanceMaskPredictor(
    model_path="backend/model_checkpoints/best_model.pth"
)
```

## Note

These files are large (~45 MB each) and are excluded from git by default.
